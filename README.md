# Notes-app-using-PHP-and-Laravel


- This is a personal project where I built a notes management web app using PHP and Laravel, running locally on a XAMPP server.  
- The application includes user login, session management, and basic CRUD functionality for notes.  
- It was designed for personal productivity and learning full-stack web development.  
- I'm planning to deploy it to a cloud platform in the coming days.
